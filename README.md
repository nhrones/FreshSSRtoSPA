# Simple SPA fresh project

This is a very simple SPA using fresh.    
The UI is esentially pure html, no jsx required         (/routes/index.tsx)     
Styling is from a plain css file in the static folder   (/static/style.css)  
All client-side code is Typescript in the /app/ folder  (/app/dom.ts)   

So, a dynamic single page `fresh` web app using only html, css, typescript.

### Usage
Start the project:
```
deno task start
```
This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
